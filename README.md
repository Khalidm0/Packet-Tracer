# 🌐 MIU Network Infrastructure – Cisco Packet Tracer Project

This project is a comprehensive simulation of an enterprise-level network using Cisco Packet Tracer, implementing all core features of real-world campus networking.

## 🧱 Project Overview

### ✅ Implemented Features

- **VLSM Design** using 10.0.0.0/8
- **Layer 3 Switching** with VLANs (100–800)
- **Trunking & EtherChannel**
- **OSPF & EIGRP Routing** with redistribution
- **Static & Default Routes**
- **DHCP Server with Relay Agents**
- **Dynamic & Static NAT with PAT**
- **Wireless Network Setup**
- **IPsec VPN Tunnel**
- **Network Management**: NTP, Syslog, DNS, Web & Email Servers

---

## 🖧 Network Highlights

- Multiple Layer 3 switches: Main-MLS, S-MLS, N-MLS, R-MLS
- Central Router: MIU-GW
- External Connections: ISP, Branch Gateway, Wireless Router
- VLANs assigned based on functional areas (e.g., Labs, Admin, Wireless)
- DHCP pools, DNS resolution for `miu.edu.eg`, and server-based services

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Cisco IOS CLI (routers and switches)
- Packet Tracer 8.x
- Subnetting with VLSM
- OSPF Area 0 and EIGRP AS 10
- IPsec VPN (AES, SHA, DH Group 5)
- NAT (Static, Dynamic with PAT)
- DHCP, NTP, Syslog, DNS, Web, and Email services

---

## 📡 Testing and Verification

- End-to-end ping tests across all VLANs
- NAT translation tables and routing tables
- Web and Email server access using domain `miu.edu.eg`
- VPN peer establishment and encrypted tunnel verification

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project simulates a fully operational enterprise network with real-world protocols, logical segmentation, secure remote access, and scalable IP addressing.

> ✅ Fully implemented, tested, and verified.
